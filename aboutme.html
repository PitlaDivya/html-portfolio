Outside the academic realm, I find solace and joy in the intellectual challenges presented by the game of chess and the therapeutic melodies of music, both serving as my trusted companions during leisure hours. Furthermore, I pride myself on my unwavering dedication to tasks at hand and my punctuality, values instilled in me through years of disciplined upbringing.

Driven by an innate curiosity and a passion for learning, I have delved into various programming languages and technologies, including HTML, CSS, React, JavaScript, SQL, C++, C, and Data Structures and Algorithms. My journey in mastering these domains is a testament to my commitment to personal and professional growth.
